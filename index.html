        <span class="smaller">says</span> <em class="larger">what?</em></h1><!--        <p> Project 2025 rushed into the news recently, and a lot of people have been talking about it. It's an incredibly dangerous set of priorities put forth by the Heritage Foundation. Below is a list of summaries about divisive topics, and what Project 2025 has to say about each one, as well as further explanations. <em>(Note: Links do not open in new windows/tabs.)</em></p> -->

        <h2>Project 2025 is a <span class="uppercase">huge</span> document.<br>
        It's overwhelming.</h2>

        <p><strong>We believe that's to keep busy, innundated voters from reading it.</strong></p>

        <p>The Heritage Foundation created this document as a dangerous set of priorities for the Republicans to follow should they win the 2024 election.

                                <p><b>From pages 293-309</b></p>

                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>From the outset, the next Administration should: Denounce efforts to place ancillary issues like climate change ahead of food productivity and affordability when it comes to agriculture.</p>

                                    <p>Too often, agricultural policy becomes synonymous with farm subsidy policy. This is unfortunate, because making them synonymous fails to recognize that agricultural policy covers a wide range of issues, including issues that are outside the proper scope of the USDA, such as environmental regulation.</p>

                                    <p>Farmers eligible to participate in ARC or PLC are generally already able to purchase federal crop insurance, policies that protect against shortfalls in expected revenue whether caused by lower prices or smaller harvests. The ARC program is especially egregious because farmers are being protected from shallow losses, which is another way of saying minor dips in expected revenue. This is hardly consistent with the concept of providing a safety net to help farmers when they fall on hard times.</p>

                                    <p>Even in a strong economy, work expectations are fairly limited: Individuals who are work-capable and without dependents are required to work or prepare for work for 20 hours per week. The work requirements are then implemented unless the state requests a waiver from the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Services. Waivers from statutory work requirements can be approved in two instances: an unemployment rate of more than 10 percent or a lack of sufficient jobs.</p>

                                    <p>Federal meal programs for K–12 students were created to provide food to children from low-income families while at school. Today, however, federal school meals increasingly resemble entitlement programs that have strayed far from their original objective and represent an example of the ever-expanding federal footprint in local school operations.</p>

                                    <p>The Department of Agriculture’s current functions are as diverse and wide-reaching as providing loans for rural development and defending U.S. livestock from <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/cattle/ticks/screwworm">flesh-eating worms</a>.</p>

                                    <p>Project 2025 would cut eligibility for SNAP benefits while moving the program to the HHS. And even though free school lunches have consistently been found to <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/3/911">improve academic performance</a>, the Heritage Foundation’s plan would restrict school meals provided through the USDA and repeal the dietary guidelines that those meals are based on.</p>

                                    <p>Under Project 2025, the USDA’s scope would narrow to the efficient production of food, undoing the department’s current strategy to promote renewable energy and protect national forests and agricultural land from the climate crisis.</p>

        <h2>Who is The Heritage Foundation,<br>
        and why does it matter?</h2>

        <p>The Heritage Foundation helped plan much of Regan's policy back in the 1980's and considers themselves a group of advisors to the Republican party. Trump has publically spoken highly of the Group's plans prior to his denial of association with Project 2025. Agenda 47, the Republican Party's official public plans, overlap in many areas with Project 2025, and we have noted where that is the case.</p>

        <p>The Heritage Foundation claims it <mark>has the support of over 100 conservative organizations,</mark> many of whom are close allies of Trump, including America First Legal which is led by <mark>Stephen Miller, a top former Trump advisor.</mark></p>

        <p><mark>Russ Vought</mark>, Trump's former Office of Management and Budget Director <mark>is one of the principal authors of Project 2025.</mark> Also involved are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><mark>Mark Meadows</mark>, Trump's former Chief of Staff <em>(recently indicted)</em></li>

            <li><mark>Jeffrey Clark</mark>, of the Center for Renewing America, who argues the DOJ should not be an independent organization <em>(recently indicted)</em></li>

            <li><mark>Christopher Miller</mark>, Trump's former acting Defense Secretary</li>

            <li><mark>Ben Carson</mark>, his former Housing and Development Secretary</li>

            <li><mark>Rick Dearborn</mark>, former Deputy Chief of Staff</li>

            <li><mark>Gene Hamilton</mark>, Trump's former Justice Department Senior Counsel</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Critics of Project 2025 say that attempts to implement much of it will render the federal government incompetent, chaotic, and amaturish.</p>
